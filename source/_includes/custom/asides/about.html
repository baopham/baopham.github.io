  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am the penguin above who loves to code.</p>
  <p>
    I am about to graduate from <a href="http://ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a> 
    with a combined major in Math and Computer Science. My bad habit or strength is that when 
    I discover a new cool technology, I will dive right into it. I do (almost) everything in 
    <a href="http://github.com/baopham/vim">Vim</a> and occasionally spend many hours to customize my zsh. 
    Depending on my mood, I can speak well in different languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, Java, C, Python.
