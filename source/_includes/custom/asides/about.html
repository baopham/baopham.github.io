  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hello. You can call me Bao.</p>
  <p>
    I am about to graduate from <a href="http://ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a> 
    with a combined major in Math and Computer Science. I do (almost) everything in 
    <a href="http://github.com/baopham/vim">Vim</a> and like to spend many hours learning new technologies and tools.
