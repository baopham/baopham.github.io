I had a quite unforgettable experience living and studying in Singapore for 4 months as an [exchange student](http://www.students.ubc.ca/global/learning-abroad/exchange/). The school I chose was [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) who was generous enough to grant me the [NUS-UBC Lee Foundation award](http://www.nus.edu.sg/iro/financial/out/others/ubc/). The school offers a lot of variety of courses especially Math: Algorithmic Graph Theory, Applied Cryptography, Numerical Analysis, Computing Theory, Financial Mathematics and many more with catching titles.<!--more--> However, I could not take any of the Math courses that I thought were interesting because there were no available spots for exchange students or I did not have the pre-reqs. I ended up in taking HCI, Parallel and Concurrency Programming, Microeconomics, Stats and Geography. If you asked me which course I found most difficult, I would say Geography! It was my first social science class I had ever taken and on top of that, it was a 3rd year level (all of the students in the class except me were majored in Social Sciences, which put me under a lot of pressure). I passed though, if you're wondering, with an acceptable grade.  

The school environment felt different than [UBC](http://ubc.ca/); everyone seemed more competitive and hard-working. The course load was roughly the same as UBC but it felt heavier at the time since I also wanted to travel and enjoy my time there. I made friends with some of the scholars, who helped me a lot with getting around the school, learning some tricks and understanding the school system. They were my group mates for an HCI project, for which we had won [3rd place](http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/socProjectShowcase/2012_2013_Sem2/), which was not a big deal at all, nope nope :P

<span class="badge">IPMI</span> stands for improving photocopy machine interface, which was what our project was about. The class was interesting in a way that it made us work in a realistic environment: contextual inquiry with target users, affinity diagram, interactive prototype, user evaluations, writing reports, etc. In the end we also had to make a video and poster to advertise our product. We introduced some "killer" features like live preview, interactive help with Google search integration, instructional videos, simpler settings...

However, the most exciting part has to be the **FOOD**. One of the things in Singapore that I really miss :( now that I'm back in Vancouver. Beside all the places that I've visited in Singapore, tasting so many different dishes is quite an achievement to me.
