You've probably heard of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)? If not, follow the link and you'll see what magics it does. I've grown tired of my old website theme and decided to try out Bootstrap. Although Bootstrap gives people the opportunity to be lazy in putting more personal touch in their website's design, it's a great starting point for a newbie like me. Hopefully, from here onwards, I can create something more uniquely looking...

Not only Bootstrap that makes a (major) change in the look of this website, from [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/), I converted to [Google Code Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/), which is also pretty cool since it can guess what language the code snippet is. However, it doesn't support as many languages as SyntaxHighlighter.

This could be a permanent change or just temporary, who knows if tomorrow I will see something even cooler than this?
