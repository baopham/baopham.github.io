This is a follow up to my [previous post](http://baopham.github.io/blog/2014/05/30/a-command-line-interface-for-vundle/). I recently switched to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) which I think is nicer to use. You can keep all dependencies together in one line and specify post-install commands, which is not possible with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).  

And so, my [vundle-cli](https://github.com/baopham/vundle-cli) is now obsolete for my own use. I have to write another CLI and this time it will take care of multiple Vim plugin managers: [vimplugin-cli](https://github.com/baopham/vimplugin-cli)
