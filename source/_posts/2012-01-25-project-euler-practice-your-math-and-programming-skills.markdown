I've recently started to participate in this site [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). It's a website with a series of mathematics/programming problems, ranging from easy to very hard. Some problems, if not solved using the right algorithm, can take more than 5 minutes to get the result (personal experience, I forgot that it was running...). So it only matters if you use correct and efficient algorithms. These problems are meant to be solved in only less than a minute.

Now I'm quite addicted to the thrilling feeling of getting the right answer. There are certainly numerous solutions out there on the web (and I admit, sometimes I have to resort to them when I'm stuck), but it's always more exciting to try and learn new algorithms and apply them to the problems.  

Check out my Git repository of my solutions (mostly in Python because I find it faster and neater to code, no?) to some of the Euler questions: [baopham/projectEuler](https://github.com/baopham/projectEuler)
