Or you can head over to [Vancouver Fountain Finder][fountain] and search for the nearest drinking fountain in Vancouver, BC.  

This is a small project I built during the school break to learn [Node.js][nodejs]. I have always wanted to learn [Node.js][nodejs] and use [Google Maps API](gmap-v3) so I tried to think of features that will let me learn new things as much as possible. Before this, I also built a simple [timer][timer] just to get started with [Node.js][nodejs] and become familiar with [Knockout.js][ko] and [Semantic-UI][semanticui]. <!--more-->I guess [Semantic-UI][semanticui] is still relatively new so I still prefer [Bootstrap][bootstrap]. A [timer][timer] because I saw my Math teacher struggling with the [online stopwatch][online-stopwatch] to set up the time for the exam... And the ads were quite distracting...

Just a quick update since now I'm back to school. Back to studying.
